# Transforming and Analyzing Data with SQL

## Project/Goals
Following e-commerce database was created based on a demo dataset with raw records ranging from 462 to over 4 millions rows.  
Project aims to achieve following objectives:

- Build a bew database using an ecommerce dataset from csv file
- Investigate and perform data cleaning and transformation: remove irrelevant, duplicated data, fix structural errors, perform type conversion, handle missing data
- Look at the dataset metadata, analyze and recommend (if any) relations between the tables and columns and constraints, build an ERD
- Understand business needs based on given datapoints and metrics
- Write and execute queries to answer business questions
- Perform the QA process for data cleaning

Given 5 separate datasets (all_sessions, analytics, products, sales_by_sku, sales_report), our goal is to create a new PostgreSQL database called ecommerce by setting up tables and importing data into the tables for each .csv file. Then, we will perform data cleaning and transformation on the ecommerce database prior to answering any possible business problems in the dataset.
